## scripts

These are the current scripts for deployment & checking. See the FIXME...

### FIXME

This approach is really horribly broken. Doing all this stuff locally and then pushing is just not the way things should be done. There are reasons why there are actual proper deployment procedures in place. There are reasons why tools that does exactly this type of stuff exists. So... this will be fixed and done properly.

However, this was not done out of ignorance, rather it was done to get the MVP going. It it minimal, it is viable, it is a product - it just gets driven by sticky-tape shell scripts for deployment. Well, then again, we have all seen worse - at least it is not completely manual.
